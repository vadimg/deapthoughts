<p>My name is Vadim Graboys.

<p>I currently work at <a href="http://chartbeat.com">Chartbeat</a>, working on a custom in-memory database, building distributed systems for machine learning, and exploring various data visualizations.

<p>Previously, I worked at <a href="http://bloomberg.net">Bloomberg</a>, where I built a domain-specific language for modeling structured securities, a simluation engine for predicting the behavior of mortgage-backed securities, and a WYSIWYG development environment for structuring mortgage-backed securities. I also built a system for finding, using public SEC filings, insider traders which seem to be illegally trading based on inside information.
