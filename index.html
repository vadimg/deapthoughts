          <h2><img src="img/construction.gif"/> Welcome to Vadim's homepage on the World Wide Web!</h2>

        <p>I currently work at <a href="https://shopspring.com">Spring</a>, leading a semi-distributed team that's building a platform for quickly and reliably building crawlers and scrapers for extracting product information from a variety of websites. I also proposed and built/PM'd the onboarding experience in the app. I also designed and built the ordering system.

        <p>Previously, I worked at <a href="http://chartbeat.com">Chartbeat</a>, where I maintained a custom realtime database written in evented C, adding the ability to run custom queries on it via Lua scripts that executed in a sandbox. I also proposed, designed, and built a system that tracked and aggregated user visits (at the time, 20,000/second) to provide accurate data for <a href="https://chartbeat.com/advertising/">Chartbeat Advertising</a>. I also built significant parts of both the backend and frontend for <a href="https://chartbeat.com/publishing/demo/">Chartbeat Publishing</a>.

        <p>Previously, I worked at <a href="http://bloomberg.net">Bloomberg</a>, where I built a domain-specific language for modeling structured securities, a simluation engine for predicting the behavior of mortgage-backed securities, and a WYSIWYG development environment for structuring mortgage-backed securities. I also built a product for finding, using public SEC filings, insider traders which seem to be illegally trading based on inside information.
